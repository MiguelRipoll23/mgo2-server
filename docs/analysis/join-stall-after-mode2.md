# The join that stalls with the client in the guest role

**What this file answers.** `P2P_CONNECT_FSM.md` §7.1b concluded that the live
join stalled because the client had resolved itself into the **host** role
(`mode = 1` in its handshake) where the reference client is a guest
(`mode = 2`), and that *"until [a client that resolves to a guest] does, no
server-side change is indicated, because the bytes this server writes are not
distinguishable from the recorded host's."* The capture of 2026-10-15
(`myserver2.pcapng`) holds a client in the guest role, and the join still
stalls: the condition is met and the explanation does not survive it. This file
records what that capture measures, what the reference captures do that this
host did not, and what was changed because of it. Every time in it is seconds
from the first datagram of the flow it names.

## 1. The client is a guest, and the join still does not finish

Decoded with `tools/map_roster_fields.py` (the handshake fields at the offsets
`docs/protocol/UDP_JOIN_FLOW.md` §3 proves them at):

| capture | handshake | PeerIdentifier | Capability | **Mode** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference client (`mgo2-game1`) | joiner | `0x0001232f` | `0x02` | **`2`** (guest) |
| `myserver.pcapng` (2026-10-15, earlier run) | joiner | `0x00000002` | `0x03` | `1` (host) |
| **`myserver2.pcapng` (2026-10-15)** | joiner | `0x00000002` | `0x03` | **`2`** (guest) |
| this host, both runs | host | `0x0000001a` / `0x00000020` | `0x02` | `1` (host) |

So the client of `myserver2` **is** the client §7.1b asked for, and its exchange
still stops short of the reference's: it never sends its own entity records and
never spawns, and the user's client shows no briefing. The client-side role is
therefore not the gate, and the difference has to be in what the two hosts
write.

## 2. The request this host never answers

The client's own records in the new capture are heard in one shape no answer
follows: a **four-byte body opening `0x83`**, on the roster identifiers
(`0x1001`/`0x9001`), carrying the array sequence byte the client last saw in its
second byte. Every reference capture holds it, and every reference host answers
it:

| capture | the client's request | when | the answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mgo2-game1` | `0x1001 83 f3 e0 7f` | t+70.226 | none (re-sent at t+72.566) |
| | `0x1001 83 f3 e0 7f` (re-sent) | t+72.566 | +0.859 s |
| | `0x9001 83 f4 00 07` | t+197.859 | +0.899 s — the player's own entity block |
| `mgo2-game2` | `0x1001 83 00 e0 7f` | t+76.539 | +2.447 s |
| | `0x1001 83 01 01 07` | t+111.542 | +0.325 s |
| `mgo2-game-started-on-briefing` | `0x1001 83 00 e0 7f` | t+92.7 | +0.4 s |
| | `0x1001 83 01 00 07` (×2) | t+200.5, 202.9 | +0.4 s |
| `mgo2-started-on-solo-game` | `0x1001 83 54 e0 7f` | t+98.665 | +0.362 s, +2.740 s |
| `mgo2-started-briefing-then-solo-game` | `0x1001 83 7e e0 7f` | t+87.469 | +0.648 s |
| | `0x9001 83 7f 01 07` | t+177.435 | none (re-sent at t+179.556) |
| | `0x9001 83 7f 01 07` (re-sent) | t+179.556 | +0.935 s → the client's own records at t+181.578 |
| `mgo2-game-joined-when-red-team-then-briefing` | `0x1001 83 03 e0 7f` | t+108.0 | answered |
| **`myserver2.pcapng`** | `0x9001 83 f3 00 07` | **t+73.487** | **none — and no re-send** |
| **`myserver.pcapng`** | `0x9001 83 f3 00 07` | **t+71.8** | **none — and no re-send** |

Three things are read off the table:

* **It is a request, not a report.** A copy that draws no answer is re-sent
  (`mgo2-game1` at 70.2 → 72.6, `mgo2-started-briefing-then-solo-game` at
  177.4 → 179.6) and the second byte climbs by one with every re-send
  (`f3`, `f4`, `f5` in game1; `00`, `01`, `02` in game2), which is the
  reliable-send retry the client uses. Both live captures hold **exactly one
  copy and no answer**, which is a client waiting on a host that writes none.
* **The answer is the room's own state.** Across the captures its members are
  the roster close (`07 00 00 00 00 00 03`, 7 B), the requesting peer's own
  roster entry (25 B opening `07 12 00 SS`), the lobby-slot array pair under
  the sequence the request named (`85 NN` / `86 NN`, 26 B each), and an empty
  `0x5001` head behind them. In the round the answer also carries the player's
  own entity block (`mgo2-game1` t+197.859: state, health, position, incapacity,
  weapon, aim under `0xd9`–`0xdf`).
* **It is answered in the pass that received it**, 0.3 to 2.9 s after the
  request, so nothing in the exchange waits on a clock.

## 3. The report a round does not answer

`MatchStartRunService` held a round open until the room held two players, on the
reading that a room's first player is briefed rather than started. The captures
measure the opposite of the delay it caused:

| capture | the client's readiness report | the round's run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mgo2-started-briefing-then-solo-game` | t+173.438, once | t+174.371 (**+0.93 s**) |
| `mgo2-game2` | t+107.978, once | t+109.120 (**+1.14 s**) |
| `myserver2.pcapng` | t+49.496, then **52.031, 54.890, 57.503, 60.215** | t+60.530 (the briefing deadline, **+11.0 s**) |

A report a capture answers is sent **once**; a report left unanswered is
re-sent every ~2.5 s until it is. The gate was therefore dropped, and a room
whose clients have all reported opens its round then, however many of them there
are — the briefing's own deadline still opens one for a player who never
reports.

## 4. What is not written, and why

The answers above carry three shapes this host cannot build, and they are
recorded rather than implemented:

* a **24-byte loadout header**, `0b SS 02` and nineteen zeros, where `SS` is
  the player's own key (`0x02`, `0x04`, `0x06`, `0x15` across captures);
* a **25-byte roster entry**, `07 12 00 SS …`, whose last eight bytes move per
  capture (`01 14 00 14 14 00 01 c0` in game1, `01 03 00 03 03 00 fe 7f` in
  started-on-solo) and no field of which is derivable from the room;
* in a round, the requesting player's **own entity block** — state, position and
  aim, which only a host that simulates the player has.

One further difference was measured and is now written:

* **The round's opening run was short.** `myserver2` wrote eleven records where
  every capture writes fourteen: the twenty-two-byte `07 0f` record and the two
  fifty-four-byte `07 2f` records the captures write there were absent, as were
  the same three records the reference hosts write through a briefing. They are
  written now, from the recorded bodies — which two captures that share no
  session hold byte for byte — in the run and on the briefing tick;
  `docs/analysis/briefing-room-state.md` carries the measurement.
* **The roster answer is written on the first copy of the profile**, where
  `UDP_JOIN_FLOW.md` §7 measures the reference host answering the **re-sent**
  copy (`mgo2-started-on-solo-game`: the joiner re-sends at t+8.780 and the
  roster follows at t+9.021). This host answers at t+0.204, 73 ms after the
  first copy, and its client never re-sends at all — the outcome
  `P2P_CONNECT_FSM.md` §7.1e describes for an answer that lands early. **The
  first copy is held now and the re-send is answered in the pass that receives
  it** (`RosterAnswerService`), with the first copy answered anyway if the
  client never re-sends.

## 5. What was changed

* `TeamArrayFramesUtils` recognises the four-byte `83 …` request and reads the
  sequence it names.
* `TeamArrayService.EnterRoomAsync` answers it with the room's own state — the
  roster close, the requesting peer's entry, the lobby-slot array pair under the
  named sequence and an empty head — in the pass that received it. **The entry it
  writes is this host's profile record**, which is the 79-to-83-byte shape a
  join's own roster run carries and not the 25-byte `07 12` record the captures
  put in this group; that record is one of the three shapes §4 leaves unwritten,
  and the difference is visible on the wire.
* `PlayerProfileHandler` routes that body there instead of dropping it as a
  profile with no name, which is what it used to do (its own log line:
  *"carries no profile; not answered"*).
* `MatchStartRunService` opens a round on the reports of the room's own clients,
  with no minimum population.
* `RosterAnswerService` holds the first copy of a peer's profile and answers its
  re-send in the pass that receives it, falling back to the first copy once the
  captures' 1.93–2.11 s retry interval has passed.
* `MatchRecordBodiesUtils`, `MatchStartRunFramesUtils` and
  `BriefingCountdownService` write the room-state records the captures carry:
  `docs/analysis/briefing-room-state.md`.

## 6. Limits

**Nothing here is verified live.** The change is measured against the captures
and the build and the codec tests pass, but no client has joined the built host:
what a client does with the answer is what would close this, exactly as
§7.1b said of the promotion gate. The three unwritten shapes of §4 remain the
most plausible next candidates if the request's answer alone does not carry the
client into the room,and both named differences on the join itself — the answer's copy and the room's
stage records — are now written.
